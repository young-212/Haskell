Somebody has to
-Shel Silverstein
Somebody has to go polish the stars
They’re looking a little bit dull
Somebody has to go polish the stars
For the eagles and starlings and gulls
Have all been complaining they’re tarnished and
worn
They sat they want new ones we cannot afford
So please get your rags
And your polishing jars,
Somebody has to go polish the stars
